      <p>I’m currently a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, studying computer science. I attribute a good amount of my success at the school to minimalism, as I am able to stay focused on my schoolwork, with little to no procrastination, and I have free time.</p>
      <p>So how does minimalism help students do better in school? Well, there are a few ways: being less prone to procrastination, time to edit your work, and having more free time / study time.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><span class="bold">Less procrastination.</span> Procrastinating can cause a lot of trouble in college. I mean if you have a week to write an essay or do your math homework and so much other things to do, you are more likely to do the other things until you realize you only have a few hours to finish your school work. But if you practice minimalism, and remove all (or most) of the non-essential things from your life, it is much easier to see that doing your homework early in the week is essential and playing video games are not. By doing your homework or projects as soon as possible, you also feel better knowing that you are done way ahead of time, and you will even have time to proofread it.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Time to edit your work.</span> Imagine if you are able to look over every paper you write in college and have days to make edits to it. I assume your grades will improve from just that alone, as all of you work will be thought through and not rushed. Also, by being able to see that your schoolwork is essential, you won’t skip doing practice problems or studying for a test, which brings me to the next point.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">More time to study and relax.</span> Minimalism is all about minimizing distractions and non-essential “obligations”, so you are bound to end up with some more free time (I’ll write a post later on how to increase your free time and lower your commitments). Use that time to breathe, relax, or read. Also, set some time aside to study if you feel you will need it. Practice the material you learned, and apply it to real world problems or do more research into it, and make it something you enjoy.</li>
      </ol>
