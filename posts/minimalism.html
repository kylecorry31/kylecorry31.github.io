      <h1>Embracing Minimalism</h1>
      <h3>7-26-2018</h3>
      <p>I'm a minimalist. I wasn't raised to have less stuff, the opposite if anything. I grew up in a household with happily married parents and a younger brother. I was spoiled as a child, and got any toy (or thing) I wanted. I must have had thousands, though I didn't play with many - I liked just collecting them, not even opening many. My father collected toys too. He had a lot of stuff. Sadly, he passed away in 2016 from cancer and we were left heartbroken, with all of his stuff. It was then that I realized that the memories and love for him were not in the stuff he owned, but rather in the time we spent together. We got rid of a lot of his stuff, and I didn't keep any things to remember him by. I knew that I would always remember him, with or without things.</p>
      <p>I began reevaluating my life and I noticed that I too owned many things, most of which I didn't use and some I didn't even want. I started getting rid of my stuff. A little at first, but soon I was getting rid of items from my small bedroom in large bags. I must have donated hundreds of items, and the more I got rid of, the better I felt. I felt free.</p>
      <p>I searched online for techniques to get rid of my possessions and came across a movement called minimalism. I stumbled across several blogs such as <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com">theminimalists.com</a> and <a href="https://zenhabits.net">zenhabits.net</a>. Using them as an example, I got rid of even more and evaluated what I truly needed in life. I didn't need a space monitor for my computer, one that I didn't even use. I didn't need 3 spare computer mice. I didn't need most of my stuff. I became much more responsible and changed a lot of my habits. Through this I learned something: we don't need stuff to be happy in life.</p>
      <p>So here I am today, writing a post on a blog that I made. I don't know exactly what I will talk about in the future, but I think the benefits of minimalism and some tips would be the best to start. I think I can provide advise on how minimalism can help you live with the passing of a loved one, and even how minimalism can help you as a student (I'm currently a college student). So that's where I'll leave this post.</p>
