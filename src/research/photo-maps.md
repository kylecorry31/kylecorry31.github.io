Many trail systems contain physical maps at the trail head. It is possible to convert a photo of these maps into a digital map that can be used on a smartphone. Having the ability to digitize these maps can make them more accessible. In this article, I'll cover the system used in Trail Sense's Photo Maps tool and how it is able to turn a photograph into a digital map.

## Background

### Perspective Correction / Warping

## Solution

1. Perspective correction
