				<h3>12-9-2017</h3>
				<p>Sustainability is a very broad term, one with many definitions. The United Nations defines sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (<a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/president/65/issues/sustdev.shtml">United Nations</a>). That definition can be extended to sustainability in general to mean what is done will meet the needs of the present and not compromise the ability for people in the future to meet their own needs.</p>
