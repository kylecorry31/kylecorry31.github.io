The survival knife from Subnautica.

![Knife](/assets/images/posts/subnautica-knife/subnautica-knife.jpg)

## Materials used

- An old machete (1095 steel would work as well)
- Resin epoxy
- White epoxy dye
- Black acrylic paint
- Mold making silicone
- Angle grinder
- Metal hole cutter
- 3D printed Subnautica knife (to make the silicone mold)

## Assembly

1. Trace the outline of the 3D printed knife onto the metal

2. Using the angle grinder, cut out the knife (don't try to cut the hole in the blade)

3. Using the metal hole cutter, cut the hole in the handle

4. Use the angle grinder or a belt sander to put an edge on the knife (both sides)

5. Optionally add the Altera logo to the blade of the knife (draw them on or etch them)

6. Create a mold of the knife handle using the silicone and the 3D print. I cut my mold lengthwise.

7. Tape the knife into the mold so it is perfectly centered between both halves. You may need to use hot glue to hold it in place.

8. Pour resin into the mold until filled (I used a small hole cut into the side of the mold) - remove bubbles if possible

9. Once dried, fill in any missed areas with resin

10. Paint the black grip portion of the handle with acrylic paint and let dry
