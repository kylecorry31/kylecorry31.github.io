The survival knife from Subnautica.

## Epoxy handle version

This version was made with an epoxy resin handle, which closely matches the knife in the game.

### Materials used

- 1095 steel
- Resin epoxy
- White epoxy dye
- Black acrylic paint
- Mold making silicone
- 3D printed Subnautica knife (to make the silicone mold)

### Tools used

- Angle grinder
- Metal hole cutter
- Belt sander (I flip a cheap hand-held belt sander upside-down, 3x18 inch belt)

### Assembly

1. Trace the outline of the 3D printed knife onto the metal (I will eventually upload a printable SVG)

2. Using the angle grinder, cut out the knife (don't try to cut the hole in the blade)

3. Using the metal hole cutter, cut the hole in the handle

4. Use the angle grinder or a belt sander to put an edge on the knife (both sides)

5. Optionally add the Altera logo to the blade of the knife (draw them on or etch them)

6. Create a mold of the knife handle using the silicone and the 3D print. I cut my mold lengthwise.

7. Tape the knife into the mold so it is perfectly centered between both halves. You may need to use hot glue to hold it in place.

8. Pour resin into the mold until filled (I used a small hole cut into the side of the mold) - remove bubbles if possible

9. Once dried, fill in any missed areas with resin

10. Paint the black grip portion of the handle with acrylic paint and let dry

## Wooden handle version

This version was made using a dead red cedar tree for the handle.

### Materials used

- 1095 steel
- Wood (I used Eastern Red Cedar, Juniperus virginiana)
- Boiled linseed oil

### Tools used

- Angle grinder
- Metal hole cutter
- Belt sander (I flip a cheap hand-held belt sander upside-down, 3x18 inch belt)
- 80, 150, 220 grit sandpaper
- Dremel (optional)

### Assembly

1. Trace the outline of the 3D printed knife onto the metal (I will eventually upload a printable SVG)

2. Using the angle grinder, cut out the knife (don't try to cut the hole in the blade)

3. Using the metal hole cutter, cut the hole in the handle

4. Use the angle grinder or a belt sander to put an edge on the knife (both sides)

5. Optionally add the Altera logo to the blade of the knife (draw them on or etch them)

6. Cut the wood into two equal thickness scales (rectangular), slightly larger than the steel

7. Line the scales up with the knife one at a time and mark the center of the hole, then use the hole cutter to cut it out

8. Glue the scales to the knife and clamp it - make sure the hole is lined up

9. Once the glue has dried, use the belt sander and Dremel to shape the knife handle to match mockups

10. Sand using 80, 150, then 220 sandpaper until smooth

11. Add boiled linseed oil to make the wood grain and color pop and allow to dry (optionally doing several coats)
