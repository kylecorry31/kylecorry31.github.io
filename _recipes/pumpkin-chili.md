title: "Vegetarian Pumpkin Chili"
---

## Ingredients

- 1 can of pureed pumpkin
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- 1 can of black beans
- 2 tbsp canola oil
- 3 Jalapenos (diced)
- 1 Onion (diced)
- TVP
- 3 tsp chili powder
- Cumin (1 - 2 tsp)
- Salt (1 tsp)
- Cilantro (1 tsp)

## Directions

1. Combine spices, pumpkin, tomatoes, and black beans in a large pot and bring to a simmer
2. Rehydrate TVP
3. Over medium-high heat, saute onions, peppers, and TVP until the TVP is cooked
4. Add the onions, peppers, and meat to the chili and simmer for 5 more minutes
5. Serve

Note: I didn't measure the spices, you can taste the chili as you slowly add the spices - there's nothing that needs to be cooked in it.
