# About Me

I am a computer science major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in my Sophomore year.

I am a frontend web designer / developer based in Chepachet, RI and have built many different websites with varying styles. I enjoy building sites with good causes such as humanitarian or environmental.

I also develop for the Android platform and have created several applications on the Play Store. I primarily use Java for all of my programs besides web design.

Finally, I am the lead Programming and Controls mentor for FRC Team 5112. I maintain the codebase for several FRC libraries which can help any team program their robots faster with more advanced features.
